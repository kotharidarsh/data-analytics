The directory contains data about the number of births in The United States Of America for the period 1994-2003

We will be working with the data set that gives us a glimpse of the Health Statistics. The data set has the following structure:
1. year - Year
2. month - Month
3. date_of_month - Day Number of the Month
4. day_of_week - Day of the week, where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday
5. births - Number of Births

We make use of Jupyter notebooks since it allows us to interleave code and text explanations, enabling us to easily explore data and create visualization.
