Unemployment rate is the percentage of individuals in the labor force without a job. The dataset we will be working with is Time Series dataset, which means that the data points (monthly unemployment rates) are ordered by time.

Te dataset has the following structure:
1. date - date, always the first of the month
2. value - corresponding unemployment rate, in percent

We analyze this time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data such as understanding if there is a seasonal effect in unemployment rates. Seasonality is when a pattern is observed on a regular, predictable basis for a specific reason.
